# Student Survey for 10/6 Hackathon

## Have you taken a statistics class before or studied statistics on your own?
I took Applied Probability here at CU last semester.  I enjoy the statistical elements but am not well versed in the deeper mathematics.  As an applied mathematics major I am interested to learn though.

## Have you done statistics on a computer before?  If so, what language and toolkit did you use?
Only simple things in languages not specifically meant for statistics (MatLab, etc.)

## Would you like the final class project to be a group installation or an individual/small-group project?
Group installation.

## For our hackathon on 10/6, would you rather work on the data side of the final project or the making/designing part? (There will be a bit of both regardless)
Data side - but I'd be happy to help wherever I am needed.

## What do you find to be the most intriguing topic within big data [e.g., quantified self, recommendation systems, tracking, data management, surveillance, etc, etc..]
Machine Learning - though I don't know too much about it.

## What do you hope to have learned by the end of this semester?
At least an introduction to working on all pieces of data collection, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.  I am hoping to be comfortable with common big data tools and hopefully how to create a large scale project.
