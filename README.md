# Student Survey for 10/6 Hackathon

## Have you taken a statistics class before or studied statistics on your own?
Yes, I've taken MCEN 3037 - Data Analysis, where we learned about statistical analyses.

## Have you done statistics on a computer before?  If so, what language and toolkit did you use?
I have not necessarily used a language to perform any analyses. I've used MATLAB and Excel to do some quick calculations for me.

## Would you like the final class project to be a group installation or an individual/small-group project?
Group Installation

## For our hackathon on 10/6, would you rather work on the data side of the final project or the making/designing part? (There will be a bit of both regardless)
Making/Designing

## What do you find to be the most intriguing topic within big data [e.g., quantified self, recommendation systems, tracking, data management, surveillance, etc, etc..]
Right now I'm very interested in data management. In particular, I'd like to further explore semantic web technologies to connect data in novel ways.

## What do you hope to have learned by the end of this semester?
I hope to have been introduced to new tools relevant to big data that I can later explore further.
