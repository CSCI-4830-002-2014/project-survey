# Student Survey for 10/6 Hackathon

## Have you taken a statistics class before or studied statistics on your own?
Yes, I took Probability and Statistics class last semester.

## Have you done statistics on a computer before?  If so, what language and toolkit did you use?
I have not.

## Would you like the final class project to be a group installation or an individual/small-group project?
I would say group (either small or large group) for the final class project because everything else is already so individual as part of our grade and it would be good to work together and not get stuck.

## For our hackathon on 10/6, would you rather work on the data side of the final project or the making/designing part? (There will be a bit of both regardless)
The marketing/designing part I think would be really cool for class time and could get really creative.

## What do you find to be the most intriguing topic within big data [e.g., quantified self, recommendation systems, tracking, data management, surveillance, etc, etc..]
I would have to say the data visualizations and collecting/tracking of the data because at the end of the day the data has to be able to speak to you/who you are presenting to so I find that so fasciniating.

## What do you hope to have learned by the end of this semester?
Different ways of presenting data, more knowledge on Big Data and ways to manipulate the data.
