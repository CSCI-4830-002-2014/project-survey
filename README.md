# Student Survey for 10/6 Hackathon

## Have you taken a statistics class before or studied statistics on your own?
No

## Have you done statistics on a computer before?  If so, what language and toolkit did you use?
No

## Would you like the final class project to be a group installation or an individual/small-group project?
A group installation, but small groups are also fine.

## For our hackathon on 10/6, would you rather work on the data side of the final project or the making/designing part? (There will be a bit of both regardless)
The making/ designing portion

## What do you find to be the most intriguing topic within big data [e.g., quantified self, recommendation systems, tracking, data management, surveillance, etc, etc..]
I would have to say that the implementation of tracking devices and small surveillance are very intriguing in big data.

## What do you hope to have learned by the end of this semester?
I would love to be able to program basic-level devices to track animals and other things. Getting into human-centered objects would also be something I would want to learn the basics of. Ruby on Rails and other programs geared toward these topics would be something I would also love to learn.
