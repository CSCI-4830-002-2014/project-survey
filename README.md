# Student Survey for 10/6 Hackathon

## Have you taken a statistics class before or studied statistics on your own?
Yes, in Statistics and Probability now. I also did some Machine Learning research with Dr. Mozer a couple years ago.

## Have you done statistics on a computer before?  If so, what language and toolkit did you use?
R, MVPStats (don't use MVPStats)

## Would you like the final class project to be a group installation or an individual/small-group project?
I would prefer individual/small-group projects. I just have a couple of things in mind for a small-group project. I am not opposed to a class project. 

## For our hackathon on 10/6, would you rather work on the data side of the final project or the making/designing part? (There will be a bit of both regardless)
No preference. Both sound interesting and nessesary.

## What do you find to be the most intriguing topic within big data [e.g., quantified self, recommendation systems, tracking, data management, surveillance, etc, etc..]
Quantified self seems neat. Generally IoT is awesome, or just intergrating systems into our "real" world that bring reality and the digital world closer together. 

## What do you hope to have learned by the end of this semester?
I would really like to have a good idea on how to gather large Data Sets, clean them, and some strong recommendations on how to present them in visually appealing ways. The front-end part is the topic where I could use the most guidance; I do not have an intuitive eye for design.
