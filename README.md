# Student Survey for 10/6 Hackathon

## Have you taken a statistics class before or studied statistics on your own?
I took statistics with computer application, which is an economics course. We learned about regression, probability, and using excel for statistics.

## Have you done statistics on a computer before?  If so, what language and toolkit did you use?
I used excel with a special toolkit (donâ€™t remember what its called).

## Would you like the final class project to be a group installation or an individual/small-group project?
Individual/small-group project.

## For our hackathon on 10/6, would you rather work on the data side of the final project or the making/designing part? (There will be a bit of both regardless)
Both equally.

## What do you find to be the most intriguing topic within big data [e.g., quantified self, recommendation systems, tracking, data management, surveillance, etc, etc..]
Data management and visualizations.

## What do you hope to have learned by the end of this semester?
Would love to dive into Hadoop and MongoDB.
