# Student Survey for 10/6 Hackathon

## Have you taken a statistics class before or studied statistics on your own?
Yes, Introduction to statistics and probability

## Have you done statistics on a computer before?  If so, what language and toolkit did you use?
No

## Would you like the final class project to be a group installation or an individual/small-group project?
I'd rather do a group project.

## For our hackathon on 10/6, would you rather work on the data side of the final project or the making/designing part? (There will be a bit of both regardless)
The data side.

## What do you find to be the most intriguing topic within big data [e.g., quantified self, recommendation systems, tracking, data management, surveillance, etc, etc..]
recommendation systems.

## What do you hope to have learned by the end of this semester?
(1) Simple analysis/visualization of data. (2) Ways to deal with huge amount of data fairly quick. e.g. how to setup database for a system like google search that handles billions of requests and stores/processes them but still is fast enough.
