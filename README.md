# Student Survey for 10/6 Hackathon

## Have you taken a statistics class before or studied statistics on your own?

Yes I have taken a research based stats class which went over the basic stuff
such as P-Values, T-test, normal distrubtion, and all the stuff you would expect from
an entry level stats class.

## Have you done statistics on a computer before?  If so, what language and toolkit did you use?

Yes I have. I have done stats in both Ruby and R.

## Would you like the final class project to be a group installation or an individual/small-group project?

Group installation.


## For our hackathon on 10/6, would you rather work on the data side of the final project or the making/designing part? (There will be a bit of both regardless)

Making/designing.

## What do you find to be the most intriguing topic within big data [e.g., quantified self, recommendation systems, tracking, data management, surveillance, etc, etc..]

Reccomendation systems, how scientific methods apply to big data. How we can optimize the efficiency of technology
and create sustainable technologies using knowledge collected from Big Data.

## What do you hope to have learned by the end of this semester?

To feel comfortable with large data sets, and have the tools neccesary to get started on a project. I don't
neccesarily want to have a small subset of tools to work with, but mostly an understanding of big data problems,
and have to right terminology/mindset for attacking a problem. i.e. I don't think that learning the specific tools
is the most important thing as tools are transient, but I think that understanding the fundamentals of Big Data
will be a crucial part of problem-solving in the future.
