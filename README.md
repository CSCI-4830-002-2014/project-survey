# Student Survey for 10/6 Hackathon

## Have you taken a statistics class before or studied statistics on your own?
Yes, but it was a long time ago.

## Have you done statistics on a computer before?  If so, what language and toolkit did you use?
I have used Matlab for statistics.

## Would you like the final class project to be a group installation or an individual/small-group project?
I would like it to be groups of at least 4.

## For our hackathon on 10/6, would you rather work on the data side of the final project or the making/designing part? (There will be a bit of both regardless)
DATA

## What do you find to be the most intriguing topic within big data [e.g., quantified self, recommendation systems, tracking, data management, surveillance, etc, etc..]
Recommendation systems

## What do you hope to have learned by the end of this semester?
How to gather and make sense of big data.
