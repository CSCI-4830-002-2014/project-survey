# Student Survey for 10/6 Hackathon

## Have you taken a statistics class before or studied statistics on your own?
Yes, 6 years ago. So, not really?

## Have you done statistics on a computer before?  If so, what language and toolkit did you use?
No

## Would you like the final class project to be a group installation or an individual/small-group project?
Leaning more towards small group / individual.

## For our hackathon on 10/6, would you rather work on the data side of the final project or the making/designing part? (There will be a bit of both regardless)
Making/Designing

## What do you find to be the most intriguing topic within big data [e.g., quantified self, recommendation systems, tracking, data management, surveillance, etc, etc..]
Tracking and surveillance

## What do you hope to have learned by the end of this semester?
How to properly handle data that is actually 'big'. Parsing through mounds of data in efficient ways, perferabbly with a refined toolset rather than the wide range we've used so far (though it's nice to know the different sets of tools). Hoping to learn some programming design that's specific to handling such a large dataset.
