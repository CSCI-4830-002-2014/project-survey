# Student Survey for 10/6 Hackathon

## Have you taken a statistics class before or studied statistics on your own?
I took a probability and statistics course my sophomore year, but at that time I was not all that interested in the subject and to make matters worse, I had one of the least active/enthusiastic teachers of all time.

## Have you done statistics on a computer before?  If so, what language and toolkit did you use?
No

## Would you like the final class project to be a group installation or an individual/small-group project?
I honestly think either would be a lot of fun. The idea of doing it as a whole group and then having it presented in the Atlas main lobby sounds awesome. So does the idea of mapping out the traffic of the entire campus as a class (someone brought this up a week or two ago when there was a map of Detroit and it stuck with me).

## For our hackathon on 10/6, would you rather work on the data side of the final project or the making/designing part? (There will be a bit of both regardless)
Front-end design has always been of high interest to me, so I would love to make something visually appealing. Dealing with data is also very cool though. It's a hard choice, so I'm glad we get to do both!

## What do you find to be the most intriguing topic within big data [e.g., quantified self, recommendation systems, tracking, data management, surveillance, etc, etc..]
I've been working with Native, a current Techstars company that helps you find local events, and they are building a graph-based recommendation system that has peaked my interest from the beginning. I don't know a whole lot about graphs and how to implement them into a recommendation system, but I love the idea of personalizing data to suit different users needs based on their interests and activities over time.

## What do you hope to have learned by the end of this semester?
That's a tough question. I would love to get better at using D3 for sure. The hardware aspect of this class is what really distinguishes it from other CS courses. Going more in depth with the Arduino will be an awesome experience. Learning more advanced javascript is also something high on my list, but not necessarily just from this class.
